- Priority 1:
    - [x] Implement test 1 (MST).
    - [x] Implement test 2 (connected components).
    - [x] Implement test 3 (job scheduling).
    - [x] Implement copy constructor and copy assignment operator for the class.
    - [x] Make the DSU work with abstract data types (vectors, objects, etc). Need overloading?

- Priority 2:
    - Overload the following `operator`s:
        - [x] `[]` (must return the component representative)
        - [x] `+`
        - [x] `+=`
        - [x] `==`
        - [x] `!=`
    - [ ] Look into type_traits and see if it's useful (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/type_traits/).
    - [ ] Add functionality to the print function to make it display as a tree.
    - [ ] Find a way to copy from the disjoint_set to a vector of vectors. Eg. Each component in the DSU should get added as a separate vector.
