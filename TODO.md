- Priority 1:
    - [x] Write code for MST problem using DSU.
    - [x] Add more test cases for MST (test1).
    - [x] Implement copy constructor and copy assignment operator for the class.
    - [ ] Write code for a problem on connected components and add test cases.
    - [ ] Make the DSU work with abstract data types (vectors, objects, etc). Need overloading?
    - [ ] Project Report
- Priority 2:
    - [x] Overload the array index operator to return the representative of the argument (e.g., `ds[1]` must return the component representative of `1`).
    - [ ] Do the same for operator+ and operator+= to implement insert().
    - [ ] Overload operator== to compare two different disjoint_set objects.
    - [ ] Look into type_traits and see if it's useful (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/type_traits/).
    - [ ] Add functionality to the print function to make it display as a tree.
    - [ ] Find a way to copy from the disjoint_set to a vector of vectors. Eg. Each component in the DSU should get added as a separate vector.
